OVERVIEW:

 This program represents a GridMonitor object that has functionalities 
 to prevent a "catastrophic meltdown".


INCLUDED FILES:

 List the files required for the project with a brief
 explanation of why each is included.

 * README - this file
 * GridMonitor.java - source file
 * GridMonitorInterface.java - source file
 * GridMonitorTest.java - source file


COMPILING AND RUNNING:

 Give the command for compiling the program, the command
 for running the program, and any usage instructions the
 user needs.
 
 These are command-line instructions for a system like onyx.
 They have nothing to do with Eclipse or any other IDE. They
 must be specific - assume the user has Java installed, but
 has no idea how to compile or run a Java program from the
 command-line.
 
 e.g.
 From the directory containing all source files, compile the
 driver class (and all dependencies) with the command:
 $ javac Class1.java

 Run the compiled class file with the command:
 $ java Class1

 Console output will give the results after the program finishes.


PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

 This is the sort of information someone who really wants to
 understand your program - possibly to make future enhancements -
 would want to know.

 Explain the main concepts and organization of your program so that
 the reader can understand how your program works. This is not a repeat
 of javadoc comments or an exhaustive listing of all methods, but an
 explanation of the critical algorithms and object interactions that make
 up the program.

 Explain the main responsibilities of the classes and interfaces that make
 up the program. Explain how the classes work together to achieve the program
 goals. If there are critical algorithms that a user should understand, 
 explain them as well.
 
 If you were responsible for designing the program's classes and choosing
 how they work together, why did you design the program this way? What, if 
 anything, could be improved? 

TESTING:

 How did you test your program to be sure it works and meets all of the
 requirements? What was the testing strategy? What kinds of tests were run?
 Can your program handle bad input? Is your program  idiot-proof? How do you 
 know? What are the known issues / bugs remaining in your program?


DISCUSSION:
 
 Discuss the issues you encountered during programming (development)
 and testing. What problems did you have? What did you have to research
 and learn on your own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you 
 fix them?
 
 What parts of the project did you find challenging? Is there anything
 that finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this project?
 
 
EXTRA CREDIT:

 If the project had opportunities for extra credit that you attempted,
 be sure to call it out so the grader does not overlook it.
