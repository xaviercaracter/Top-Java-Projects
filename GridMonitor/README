OVERVIEW:

 This program represents a GridMonitor object that has functionalities 
 to prevent a "catastrophic meltdown".


INCLUDED FILES:

 List the files required for the project with a brief
 explanation of why each is included.

 * README - this file
 * GridMonitor.java - source file
 * GridMonitorInterface.java - source file
 * GridMonitorTest.java - source file
 * Assortment of text test files


COMPILING AND RUNNING:
 
 From the directory containing all source files, compile the
 Tester class (since there is no driver class) with the command:
 $ javac GridMonitorTest.java

 Run the compiled class file with the command:
 $ java GridMonitorTest

 Console output will give the results after the program finishes.


PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

 
 This program functions by accepting a filename that is passed into the constructor,
 where the many field variables and arrays will become initialized and inhabited through use of
 nested for loops and two-dimensional arrays.  The main interface that is used, houses the calculation methods that are required
 for the Grid Monitor object.  The program then uses its few methods to perforem calculations 
 on the numbers within the two-dimensional array, some of the calculations being summations and averaging.  
 These calculation methods also have their own two-dimensional arrays to store their respective datasets.  
 The copies of the arrays are then returned by the methods.
