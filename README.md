# **Overview**
This repo contains both my best personal work in Java as well a my best Java projects thus far at Boise State University
### **BSU Projects**
- HashTest
  - I created a Hash Table data structure and developed automated testing that confirmed data insertion and compared searching speeds using various data types.
- GridMonitor
  - This program represents a GridMonitor object that has functionalities to prevent a "catastrophic meltdown".
- CircuitTracer
  - The program uses a brute force algorithm to find the most efficient paths on a “Circuit Board”.
### **Personal Projects**
- FormatChecker
  - This program checks the format between two files that contain matrix data, only accepting the files that fit a specific format.
  - **Value Statement**: The purpose of this project was to have a program that will check the various matrix input files versus having to reiterate the solution across multiple assignments.
- FileDirCopier
  - This program takes two directories (a source and destination) and copies the contents of the source directory into the destination directory
  - **Value Statement**: I wanted to find a solution to copying entire directories without having to constantly drag and drop files everywhere.  With my program, I was able to do some much-needed hard drive cleanup in a more efficient manner, as well as having total control of where I am sending my files.
